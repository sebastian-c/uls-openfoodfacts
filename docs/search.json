    "text": "Processing\nIn order to start using this data, we first had to filter and process it.\nNutriscore is one dimension available on OpenFoodFacts among others, including nutritional data per 100g 2:2 We chose these nutrients as they’re the most common ones to find. Stepping out of these moves you from 90% of foods having them, to 90% without.\n\nEnergy (kJ)\nProtein\nSugar\nSodium\nSalt\nSaturated fat\nFat\nCarbohydrates\n\nIt also contains tags for all foods, making it easy to specify food types. Calculating the Nutriscore values for everything would be tedious and take a long time to analyse so we’re going to look at a few products:\n\nBreakfast cereals\nIced teas3\nBiscuits and cakes\n\n3 Iced tea varies a lot in sugar content as it’s often geared to the health market and so has options with either low sugar, or where some of the sugar has been replaced with artificial sweeteners.All of these foods are highly variable in sugar and fat content so it should give us an idea of what causes Nutriscore to change."

In particular, we noticed some salt contents that were peculiarly high.4 We chose to remove all values with higher than 2% salt and the corresponding value for sodium.54 Hello Panda may not be the healthiest treat, it’s unlikely to contain more than its own weight in salt.5 Table salt is ~40% sodium, so our threshold was (\\(2\\times0.4=0.8\\))\nGiven that the data we had retained was relatively complete, we opted to discard any rows with missing values rather than imputing. This caused a loss of ~15% of our data."

    "text": "Exploration\n\nNutrients\nThe first thing to look at when you have a new dataset is distribution. Let’s look at overall distributions of each of our dependent variables.\n\n\n\nNutrient distributions of biscuits, iced tea and breakfast cereals\n\n\nA number of these have large outliers, but after sodium and salt were taken out in the processing step, none of them seem too terrible.66 Turns out the reason there’s a huge outlier here is the presence of some dried coconut that counts as a biscuit. We didn’t remove it as there are a number of biscuits from Brittany not too far away with astonishing levels of saturated fats.\nThe next stage of describing out nutrients would be to split these by type of food.\n\n\n\nNutrient distributions of a subset of food categories\n\n\nThere are some very clear patterns in the nutrient distributions of food category.7 Iced tea behaves quite differently to the others as it has virtually no nutrients other than sugar and energy. Biscuits seem to have the most normally distributed nutrients, while cereals seem to have a number of healthy ones with low sodium and fat but a large spread with more of those nutrients.7 Please note that the x-axes are free. I wasn’t able to fix it per column and it would have been pointless to fit it for the whole grid.\n\n\nNutriscores\nNow that we’ve looked at the nutrients, we’ll turn our attention to the nutriscores.\n\n\n\nNutriscore distribution in our data\n\n\nOut data is mostly unhealthy food, it would seem. We have a lot of foods with scores of D and E, but not so many with scores of A and B. Given that most of the data in OpenFoodFacts is processed food, this isn’t surprising - but our choices of category are certainly not helping our cause.\n\n\n\nNutriscore distribution by food\n\n\nSplitting up the Nutriscores by category, we can see that iced teas are generally unhealthy, with not a single one getting a score of A. Biscuits and cakes show an expected distribution as do breakfast cereals as there’s a lacuna between All-Bran and Coco Pops.88 I suspect that the reason that there are so many Cs are unhealthy cereals adding fibre to their cereals to get to the first “healthy-ish” tier."
