    "text": "Processing\nIn order to start using this data, we first had to filter and process it.\nNutriscore is one dimension available on OpenFoodFacts among others, including nutritional data per 100g 1:1 We chose these nutrients as they’re the most common ones to find. Stepping out of these moves you from 90% of foods having them, to 90% without.\n\nEnergy (kJ)\nProtein\nSugar\nSodium\nSalt\nSaturated fat\nFat\nCarbohydrates\n\nIt also contains tags for all foods, making it easy to specify food types. Calculating the Nutriscore values for everything would be tedious and take a long time to analyse so we’re going to look at a few products:\n\nBreakfast cereals\nIced teas2\nBiscuits and cakes\n\n2 Iced tea varies a lot in sugar content as it’s often geared to the health market and so has options with either low sugar, or where some of the sugar has been replaced with artificial sweeteners.All of these foods are highly variable in sugar and fat content so it should give us an idea of what causes Nutriscore to change."

    "text": "Filtering\nEven after reducing our dataset, we still noticed some unusual values. In particular, we noticed some salt contents that were peculiarly high.3 We chose to remove all values with higher than 2% salt and the corresponding value for sodium.43 Hello Panda may not be the healthiest treat, it’s unlikely to contain more than its own weight in salt.4 Table salt is ~40% sodium, so our threshold was (\\(2\\times0.4=0.8\\))\nGiven that the data we had retained was relatively complete, we opted to discard any rows with missing values rather than imputing. This caused a loss of ~15% of our data."
